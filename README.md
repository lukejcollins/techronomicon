# Techronomicon 🧙‍♂️🔮

Welcome to the Techronomicon, a mystical portal where technology meets the arcane! Techronomicon will be a tech blog focused on Immutable OSs, cloud infrastructure and a blend of other esoteric miscellanea. Our words of power are weaved with Python and Django, while our scrolls are stored in the great libraries of AWS. 🌩️📚

## Current State of the Repository 🌒

As of now, the mighty spellbook contains the basic foundation of a Django project and a Dockerfile. These ancient scrolls are only the beginning:

- The **Dockerfile** is capable of conjuring a container that can run the Django site. It’s just a prototype and will evolve as the secrets of the arcane get unraveled.
  
- The **Django project** is in its nascent form, resembling an alchemist’s first draft of a potion. It currently holds a basic blog page, as if peering through a looking glass into a world yet to be fully formed. 

Remember, fellow practitioner, that these are mere beginnings. As the moon goes through its phases, so will Techronomicon. Through the coming weeks and months, we will embark on a mystical journey, adding new spells, summoning new entities, and drawing from the well of ancient knowledge.🌟

## The Path Forward 🕯️

As we traverse the treacherous path of development, Techronomicon will be imbued with spells from various mystical sources. Our prime focus will be:

- **Immutable Operating Environments**: Learn the art of unchanging, stable environments where the essence of the system is locked in time.

- **Cloud Infrastructure in AWS**: Soar through the clouds and harness the power of AWS, where you can summon and bind elemental forces at will.

- **Esoteric and Mystical Verses**: Unearth hidden knowledge and secrets, melding tech and arcane wisdom in cryptic verses, but with a hint of jest.

## Tools & Technology 🧰

- **Django**: A powerful Python web framework which will be used for weaving the spells into web forms.
- **Docker**: Conjure isolated environments in containers, easily reproducible by other mystics.
- **AWS**: The grand library of Amazon Web Services, where our incantations will take physical form.

## How to Contribute 🤝

## Notes for Apprentices 📜

This is an educational endeavor. As we craft our spells, we’ll learn and grow. This space is not only for the experienced warlocks but also for the young wizards who are just starting to discover their powers.

In stars and clouds,
Techronomicon 🧙🌩️
